# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_RFC
The Python program utilizes scikit-learn to diagnose breast cancer using a Random Forest classifier. After loading the breast cancer dataset, the features and labels are printed to provide insights into the dataset structure. The data is then split into training and test sets with an 80-20 ratio. A Random Forest classifier is instantiated, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using Randomized Search Cross-Validation to optimize its performance. The best hyperparameters are then applied to the classifier. The program evaluates the model through 5-fold cross-validation, computing accuracy scores and subsequently predicting target values on the test set. Precision, accuracy, and recall scores, specificity and sensitivity are calculated, along with a detailed classification report and a confusion matrix visualized as a heatmap. Additionally, the first decision tree in the Random Forest is plotted for further analysis. The program provides a comprehensive overview of the breast cancer diagnosis model and its evaluation.
